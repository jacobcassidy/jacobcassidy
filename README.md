# Welcome!

My name is Jacob Cassidy and I've been a professional Front-End Developer for over a decade. It's been an incredible journey working with a diverse range of companies, from Fortune 500 brands, to mom-and-pop shops, and everything in between. Currently, I freelance as a software consultant for several companies and am looking to transition into a single full-time role on a team thatâ€™s passionate about their projects.
